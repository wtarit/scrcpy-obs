# scrcpy Source for OBS

Android screen and camera mirroring for OBS Studio, powered by [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy). Each source captures a connected Android device without requiring scrcpy desktop window capture. Allow you to stream/record your Android device at native source resolution.
